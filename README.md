# Ensemble-Model-for-Plant-Disease-Diagnosis-Integrating-Convolutional-and-Transformer-Architectures
Developed an ensemble model for plant disease classification, combining VGG16 and Vision Transformers (ViT). The model leverages VGG16 for local feature extraction and ViT for capturing global dependencies.
